# React Form Submit Backend

Very simple backend for the [react-submit-form app](https://github.com/brianjsyang/react-form-submit).

No database connect, data is simply stored in the posts.json file for simplicity.

Only meant to run on localhost, to experiment with the express.js, node.js features.
